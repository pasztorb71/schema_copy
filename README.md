# schema_copy

This is a very early version, where the parameters are in the program (variables).

The main variables:
  src_schema = 'Vehicle'
  dest_schema = 'Auth'
  src_path = 'c:/GIT/MLFF/' + src_schema
  dest_path = 'c:/GIT/MLFF/' + dest_schema
  repl_from = 'vehicle'
  repl_to ='auth'
  
Before run the program the det_path must exist and empty!
